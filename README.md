# YT Music Flutter (Learning Project)

This is a simple Flutter app built for learning purposes to explore how to interact with YouTube videos and integrate streaming functionality into a Flutter app. The app allows you to search for YouTube songs and play them directly inside the app. 

### Key Learning Goals:
- Understanding how to fetch YouTube videos using the [youtube_explode_dart](https://pub.dev/packages/youtube_explode_dart) package.
- Learning to use the [audioplayers](https://pub.dev/packages/audioplayers) package for audio playback in Flutter.
- Exploring the [share_plus](https://pub.dev/packages/share_plus) package to implement sharing functionality.
- Gaining experience with Flutter UI design and state management.

## Features

- **Search for YouTube Songs**: Search YouTube songs by title.
- **Stream Audio**: Play the audio of selected YouTube songs within the app.
- **Sharing Functionality**: Share the currently playing song with others using the `share_plus` package.
- **Learning & Experimenting**: This app was developed as part of my learning process to understand Flutter's integration with YouTube and audio streaming.
